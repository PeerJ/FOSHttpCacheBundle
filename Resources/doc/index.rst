FOSHttpCacheBundle
==================

.. note::

    This documentation is for the (outdated) version 1.x of the bundle. For the
    current 2.x versions, please refer to the `current documentation`_.

This is the documentation for the `FOSHttpCacheBundle <https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSHttpCacheBundle>`_.
Use the FOSHttpCacheBundle to:

* Set path-based cache expiration headers via your application configuration;
* Set up an invalidation scheme without writing PHP code;
* Tag your responses and invalidate cache based on tags;
* Send invalidation requests with minimal impact on performance with the FOSHttpCache_ library;
* Differentiate caches based on user *type* (e.g. roles);
* Easily implement your own HTTP cache client.
